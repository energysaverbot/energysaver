# ‚òÄÔ∏è Toy Example: Solar-Powered Task Scheduling Visualization

This repository provides a **toy example** demonstrating how solar power availability, task validity, and scheduling evolve over discrete time slots under different algorithmic settings.  
It visualizes how the system schedules tasks in the presence (or absence) of solar energy and battery support.

## üìÅ Figures Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Incoming Solar Power (Predicted)
![Incoming Solar Power](pred_power.png)

**Description:**  
This figure shows the **predicted incoming solar power** (`S_t`) at each time slot.  
It represents the renewable energy available to the system over time.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Incoming Predicted Tasks and Their Validity
![Incoming Predicted Tasks](incomingpredictedtasks.png)

**Description:**  
This figure visualizes the **predicted tasks arriving at each time slot** and their **validity** extending across adjacent slots.  
- **Dark Blue Cells:** Tasks that arrived in the current time slot.  
- **Light Blue Cells:** Tasks carried over from the previous slot (still valid).  
Each cell corresponds to one task (œÑ‚ÇÅ, œÑ‚ÇÇ, ‚Ä¶), and the total number of valid tasks is shown on top of each bar.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Algorithm 2 (No Battery): Solar Availability and Scheduled Tasks
![Algorithm 2](alg2.png)

**Description:**  
This plot represents **Algorithm 2 (No Battery)**, where tasks are scheduled only when solar power is directly available.  
It shows how power consumption (`P_t`) corresponds to solar input (`S_t`) at each slot.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Algorithm 2 + Algorithm 4: Offline Schedule for Infinite Battery (TS-GES-SIB)
![Algorithm 4](alg4.png)

**Description:**  
This figure corresponds to the **offline scheduling** scenario with an **infinite battery**.  
Excess solar energy from earlier slots can be stored and used later, ensuring smoother task execution and balanced utilization across time.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Algorithm 2 + Algorithm 6 + Algorithm 5: Online Schedule for Fixed Battery (TS-GES-SFB)
![Algorithm 6](alg6.png)

**Description:**  
This plot shows the **online scheduling** case with a **fixed battery capacity**, where task execution adapts dynamically based on real-time solar input and storage limits.
